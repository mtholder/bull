Dependencies for building:
    1. autoconf
    2. automake
    3. make
    4. a C++ compiler
    5. the NEXUS class library (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/ncl )


Assuming that you have NCL_INSTALL_DIR as an environmental variable that is set
    to the path that served as the prefix for your NCL installation (the default
    is /usr/local/lib if you did not use the --prefix argument to NCL's configure
    script), then the following should work.
    
From the source code repository do the following (where $ is the bash prompt, 
    not a character that you should type):

$ sh bootstrap.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=$PWD/installed --with-ncl=$NCL_INSTALL_DIR 
$ make 
$ make install
$ make install check
